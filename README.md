TITLE OF THE PROJECT: COVID19-AIWEBAPP
DESCRIPTION:
Covid19-AIWebapp is an automated flask web application which helps radiologists to detect diseases from images of chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT-scan). 

To investigate the importance and utility of chest X-ray and CT-scan in the diagnosis of covid19, as an increasing piece of evidence suggest that chest X-ray 
and CT-scan would prove useful in clinical pathway in diagnosing covid-19. 

There is a limited number of covid-19 test kits available in hospitals due to increasing cases daily. 

Therefore, I have implemented an automatic detector system as a quick alternative diagnosis option to prevent covid-19 from spreading among people.

Deep learning is one of the most effective Artificial Intelligence techniques to analyze chest X-ray and CT-Scan images for efficient and reliable COVID-19 screening.

Process Flow:
Download repo, change to directory of repo, go to command prompt and run pip install -r requirements.txt
On command prompt, run python app.py
Open your web browser and go to 127.0.0.1:5000 to access the Flask App
